# MSW Example Implementation

![MSW Logo](https://mswjs.io/_astro/msw.d6PiRO0h.svg)

This project demonstrates an example implementation of Mock Service Worker (MSW) for JavaScript Proof of Concept (POC) demos. It showcases how to mock CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a 'posts' resource.

## Live Demo
Wait for Heroku to load the app. May take up to 1 minute.

## What This Demo Covers

- **Create**: Simulating the addition of new posts
- **Read**: Fetching individual posts and lists of posts
- **Update**: Modifying existing post data
- **Delete**: Removing posts from the system

These mocked operations allow for rapid prototyping and testing of front-end functionality without the need for a real backend server.

## Styling

This project utilizes [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) for styling and UI components. MUI provides a comprehensive suite of UI tools and pre-built components that help create a polished and responsive user interface with minimal effort.

For a detailed guide on how to use MSW in your projects, implement these CRUD operations, and integrate MUI for styling, check out my blog post:
